/**
 In order to unit test swizzling of methods related to receiving push notification,
 we have to solve issue of missing UNUserNotificationCenter and inability to set UIApplication.delegate.
 Instead of using UIApplication and UNUserNotificationCenter directly, we'll
 work with protocols that have delegates we need.
 In unit tests we can pass different object that conform to those protocols.
