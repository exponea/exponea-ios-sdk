To be able to send [iOS push notifications](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/ios-sdk-push-notifications) using Engagement, you must obtain an Apple Push Notification service (APNs) authentication token signing key and configure the APNs integration in the Engagement web app.

> 📘
>
> Refer to the [Apple Push Notifications developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications) for details.

## Obtain an APNs key

1. In your [Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list), navigate to `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles` > `Keys`.

2. Add a new key and select APNs.

> Make sure to save the downloaded key in a secure place, as you cannot download this more than once.

## Add APNs key to Engagement

1. Open the Engagement web application and navigate to `Data & Assets` > `Integrations`. Click `+ Add new integration`.

4. Select an `API mode` (`Development` or `Production`) and enter the `Team ID` and `Key ID`. Open the key file you downloaded in a text editor and copy-paste its contents into the `ES256 Private Key` field. Enter your app's `Bundle ID`. Click `Save integration` to finish.

   > ❗️
   >
   > API environment (`Development` or `Production`) cannot be changed later. You have to create a new integration in case you want to use a different environment. If you encounter BadDeviceToken errors, verify that you have selected the correct API environment.
   
   > ❗️
   >
   > Only one APNs integration can be active at the same time in an Engagement project. If you'd like to use both the development and production APNs environments at the same time, you need two separate Engagement projects.

   > ❗️
   >
   > Ensure the `Application Bundle ID` matches the `Bundle Identifier` in your application target in Xcode. If they don't match, push notification will fail to be delivered.


5. Navigate to `Settings` > `Project settings` > `Channels` > `Push notifications` > `iOS Notification` and set `Apple Push Notification Service integration` to `Apple Push Notification Service`.
