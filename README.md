It has been written 100% in Swift with ‚ù§Ô∏è

## üì¶ Installation

### CocoaPods

```ruby
# Add this under your main application target
pod "ExponeaSDK", "~> 2.21.3"

# If you also use rich push notifications,
# add this line to your notification service extension target.
pod "ExponeaSDK-Notifications", "~> 2.21.3"
```

> Read more about rich push notifications support [here](./Documentation/PUSH.md).

### Carthage

> Carthage will by default build both `ExponeaSDK` and `ExponeaSDKNotifications` frameworks. The latter one is only supposed to be used in a notification service extension if you wish support rich push notifications. Read more about rich push notifications [here](./Documentation/PUSH.md).

```
github "exponea/exponea-ios-sdk" ~> 2.21.3
```
> And then in your Command line tool type ```carthage update --use-xcframeworks --platform ios```

> In your Target's General tab, under section Frameworks, Libraries and Embeeded Content, add the carthage built xcfw into it and set to them 'Embed & Sign'.
